# An R Package Implementing the Multi-Objective Landscape Explorer (MOLE)

The `moleopt` package implements an R interface to the C++ code for the bi-objective MOLE. Further, some tools for visualizing and analyzing the output of MOLE, as well as some simple benchmark functions are implemented.

Project structure

- [`src`](./src/): C++ source code for the bi-objective MOLE, and Rcpp interfacing

- [`R`](./R/): R package code

- [`scripts`](./scripts/): R scripts demonstrating the usage of the package
